Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for! I'm in a field methods class working on a Papuan language and I think I'm finding something exactly like what you're describing.

The word in question is /?ani/, where ? is a segment conditioned by noun class and number. Relevant forms, with the consultant's own glosses. Consultant is elderly with adequate but not fluent grasp of English:

>ɲegɨr **ɲani** rowem

>`stick and fruit'

>pahwi rowep **pani** ahwi aropa **hani** pahwi chup

>`red berries and red cloth and red paper' (stacked on top of each other)

>Lisa kwapwe urupat **kwani** Ivan

>`Lisa and Ivan are home'

>chato **gani** mihig

>`up on the hill'

>chato **gani** weimog

>`up on the ridge'

>Mary **kw-ani** John **ch-ani** nəgachich yopugi ɲɨrɨk

>(Mary 3sg.f-and John 3pl.common_gender-and children good family)

>`Mary and John and children are a good family'

In the second utterance, *kwapwe* is inflected for 3sg.f, which is points in favor of the *with* interpretation of /?ani/. 

But this interpretation runs into trouble in the last utterance: this naive version would have produced *...John n-ani...* using the 3sg.m segment. Instead we find the 3pl.c segment, showing that /?ani/ is somehow agreeing with both Mary and John, something a hierarchical embedding of adjuncts wouldn't have us expect. 

So a modified account might be that /?ani/'s ? is resolved by considering all the N's above /?ani/ in the parse tree, but I'm not sure if that holds for the second glossed form. *h-*, I think, is the form that corresponds to *aropa*, not the conjunction of *aropa* and *rowep*.

Anyway, that was a huge tangent. Because q
